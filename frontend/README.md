## Structure
All files and folders use PascalCase for naming.
The code building pages and components needed to build pages are in folder src/components. Most of pages are folded by their catogaries. For example, Dashboards.js and the buttons on the dashboard NavButton.js are in the src/component/dashboard. Moreover, AddEditImpactRisk.js(addEditImpactRisk page) and ImpactRisks(List of Impact Risks page) are in src/components/impactRisk
