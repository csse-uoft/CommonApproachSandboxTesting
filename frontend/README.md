## Introduction

### Framework: React.js

React.js serves as the core framework for the frontend of the Common Approach Sandbox. This JavaScript library was chosen for its powerful component-based architecture, which facilitates the creation of reusable UI components and ensures a consistent user experience. React.js also excels in maintaining performance through its virtual DOM, enabling efficient updates and rendering.

### Styling and Theming: MaterialUI

To achieve a cohesive and visually appealing design, the project leverages MaterialUI (MUI) for theming and component styling. MaterialUI provides a rich set of pre-designed components adhering to Google's Material Design principles, ensuring a modern and professional look and feel. It also simplifies the process of customizing themes to align with specific branding requirements.

### Programming Language: JavaScript

JavaScript serves as the primary programming language for the frontend development. Its flexibility and vast ecosystem make it an ideal choice for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces. JavaScriptâ€™s compatibility with React.js ensures seamless integration and enables the use of modern ES6+ features for cleaner and more efficient code.

### Visualization: 

#### SankeyDiagram.js

The Sankey Diagram in the project is built using D3.js within the SankeyDiagram.js module. D3.js is a powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations. By leveraging D3.js, the project ensures that the Sankey Diagram is both visually compelling and capable of representing complex data flows effectively. Additionally, D3.js allows users to specify the position of nodes in relation to their respective columns, providing greater control and customization over the layout and structure of the diagram. However, the current implementation does not provide an option for users to specify the color of the flows or nodes, which may be considered for future enhancements.

#### Cytoscape

The project also uses Cytoscape to generate node graphs within the NodeGraph.js module. Cytoscape provides a highly customizable framework for visualizing networks, allowing users to modify the colour and position of nodes and edges. Users can also remove or omit specific nodes from the graph, offering flexibility to tailor the visualization to their needs. This feature enables a more interactive and personalized experience, making it easier to analyze complex relationships within the graph.

## Structure

The source code for building pages and their components is located in the `src/components` folder. Most pages are organized by their respective categories. For example, `Dashboards.js` and the dashboard navigation button `NavButton.js` are found in `src/components/dashboard`. Additionally, `AddEditImpactRisk.js` (the Add/Edit Impact Risk page) and `ImpactRisks.js` (the Impact Risks listing page) reside in `src/components/impactRisk`.
